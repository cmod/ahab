It's like 2003 once again,

### Ahab! ###

This template is simple. Really, *really* simple. 
But you know what? I poked around quite a bit and didn't find any 
other super-simple baseline .mobi templates. So here ya go. 

It's also meant to be a bit geeky. It's for those of us who like to hand-code 
websites. Who want to know what's going on under the hood. Who are obsessive
about CSS class naming and indent styling and get pleasure knowing the 
innards of the machines they produce are as beautiful and effecient as 
possible. 


### Mobi? ###

Mobi is Kindle's ebook format. It's sort of like epub's step-brother. 
If you have a properly produced .mobi file you can publish on the 
[Kindle Direct Publishing](http://kdp.amazon.com) platform. 

Why .mobi? [Pareto priciple](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) ("80/20 rule"). I want to leverage existing marketplaces for digital 
publishing, and Amazon covers 80%+ of the market I'm interested in reaching. 
iBooks just doesn't have the audience, nor is the platform presently 
inviting (IMO) from a systems and ubiquity perspective. Kindle hits iPad, 
iPhone, Android, web, desktop ... EVERYWHERE. And it does seamless syncing. 
I like all that. *Readers* like all that. 

There's other engaged and energized communities emerging around products like
[Readmill](http://readmill.com/) but I don't want to have to deal with 
selling stuff on my own. And I do want to sell stuff. That's part of the 
experiment. And, I think it behooves anyone interested in the future of 
publishing to know the biggest guy in the room really well, even if you 
don't like them. (I've got nothing against Amazon but it seems like
a lot of other folks do.) 


### This template ###

This template is meant to get you from *thinking* about publishing a piece of 
text you have to *actually publishing* it on Kindle Direct Publishing. If you 
have a long-form blog post composed mainly of text, I suspect you could 
convert it to a proper .mobi file using this template in fifteen minutes. 
Obviously, more complex texts (and cover production, etc) take more time. 

So this template is mainly about minimizing friction. 


### Resources ###

- Kindle Format 8 [Guidelines](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000729511) are a good place to start
- [Kindle Previewer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000765261)
- [Kindlegen](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000765211)

Yes — you're correct! You have to use a `COMMAND LINE PROGRAM` to make .mobi 
files for Kindle Previewer to preview them. 

At the risk of this file turning into a horribly complex tutorial, after you
install Kindlegen, open your `Terminal` program (assuming OS X), type 
`"kindlegen content.opf"` from inside the `ahab` directory and Kindle Previewer 
should be able to open the content.mobi file it spits out. 

Kindle Previewer is pretty kludgy, but it gets the job done. It saves you from 
trying to send .mobi files to seven different devices. And speeds up development / 
testing / iteration time. 

You will, at some point, want to send something to a bunch of Kindles. This 
utility is useful for that:

- [Send to Kindle](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/?docId=1000778781)

There are a lot of people out there who have spent a lot more time working on
this stuff than I have. I referenced Liz Castro's [blog](http://www.pigsgourdsandwikis.com/)
any number of times. 


### Covers ###

So Amazon revised their cover guidelines in early 2012. Here's the latest:
- [Creating a catalog/cover image](https://kdp.amazon.com/self-publishing/help?topicId=A2J0TRG6OPX0VM)

Here are the base requirements:

> Requirements for the size of your cover art: 
>
> • Minimum of 1000 pixels on the longest side 
> • Ideal height/width ratio of 1.6 
> 
> For better quality, we recommend that images be 2500 pixels on the longest side. 

The 1.6 ratio bit is weird. It's the dimensions for the Kindle Fire, which I 
have to admit, feels odd. This is partially awkward since hardware eink Kindles have
a screen ratio closer to 1.3. 

Amazon currently doesn't offer the ability to include multiple covers for their
different devices. I feel inclined to design for hardware Kindles since I'm 
still not convinced anyone actually uses/reads on first generation Kindle Fires. 

For some reason, .png is not allowed for cover images. So make sure you stick with 
.jpg or .tiff. .pngs are allowed everywhere else. 


### CSS ###

Kindle Format 8 supports CSS media queries. It seems a little bit out of the
scope of a baseline template, but if you're interested, [Liz Castro](http://www.pigsgourdsandwikis.com/2012/01/media-queries-for-formatting-poetry-on.html)
explains all. 

@font-face rules only work on Kindle Fire.

Actually, a lot of css rules only work on Fire. Floats, for example. The simpler
you keep your CSS, the saner you'll be. 

Here's the full list of KF8 HTML and CSS support:

* [List of support HTML and CSS tags](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000729901)


### What are these other files? ###

Toc.ncx & content.opf are the two slightly alien files of this collection.

OPF means "Open Page Format". From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB#Open_Packaging_Format_2.0.1):

> The OPF file, traditionally named content.opf houses the EPUB book's 
> metadata, file manifest, and linear reading order. This file has a 
> root element package and four child elements: metadata, manifest, 
> spine, and guide. All of these except guide are required. Furthermore, 
> the package node must have the unique-identifier attribute. The .opf 
> file's mimetype is application/oebps-package+xml.

The .ncx file is explained thusly: 

> The NCX file (Navigation Control file for XML), traditionally named toc.ncx, 
> contains the hierarchical table of contents for the EPUB file. The specification 
> for NCX was developed for Digital Talking Book (DTB), is maintained by the DAISY 
> Consortium, and is not a part of the EPUB specification. The NCX file has a 
> mimetype of application/x-dtbncx+xml.

Exciting stuff! *zzzzzz*

I've done my best to obviate thinking too much about these files.


### Publish! ###

So you have your cover. You have your properly formated .mobi. You've tested it
in Kindle Previewer and it looks pretty good on all the devices. Now, how do you
publishg? 

You can just mail the .mobi file to friends, put it up on a server, upload it 
to a forum — distribute any way — and any Kindle will be able to open the file. 

But if you want to "publish" it on Amazon — set prices and get it properly listed — 
then [Kindle Direct Publishing](http://kdp.amazon.com) is what you want. It should
be pretty self explainatory. 


### Extend ###

This is by no means exhaustive. It's meant to give anyone interested in .mobi a
little boost. I've tried to strip away all the unnecessary gunk. What's remaining
should be relatively self explanatory.
